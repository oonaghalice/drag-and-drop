# drag-and-drop

Typescript project completed during the acquisition of the IBM Understanding Typescript badge, completed under the support of those videos and the instructor to practise and demonstrate typescript knowledge.

This code allows you to visualise different projects you are working on by adding them to a list on the DOM with descriptions. It allows you to organise these projects into active and finished lists with 'drag and drop' capability allowing the user to move items into the different lists to manage project status easily.
